# Complaint Management System (CMS)

A full-stack web application prototype developed for the Municipal IT Division to manage internal employee complaints and administrative issue tracking. Built using **JSP, Jakarta EE, DBCP, and MySQL**, this system supports synchronous complaint submission, management, and resolution through structured form-based interactions only.

## üìå Project Overview

This system enables:

- **Employees** to submit, view, edit, and delete unresolved complaints.
- **Admins** to view all complaints, update their statuses with remarks, and delete any complaint.

All backend interactions are strictly performed using **HTML `<form>` submissions** via **HTTP GET and POST**, with no use of AJAX or JavaScript-based asynchronous methods.
